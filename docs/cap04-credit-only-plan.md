# CAP-04: credit-only deployment constraints

**Updated:** 8 October 2026. **Status:** owner constraints recorded; design and deployment remain open.

## Owner decisions

The owner created a personal AWS account during this planning session. Their console screenshot shows the **Free account plan, $100.00 credits remaining and 183 days remaining, ending 7 April 2027**. This is screenshot evidence, not an account audit. Their constraint is **$0 out-of-pocket spending**. They want a public link for independent testers for approximately two months and have no domain. These decisions replace the supervised, owner-domain assumptions in the [6 October draft](cap04-aws-design-draft.md).

The advertised $200 is not the current balance or authorization to charge a payment method; only $100 is presently evidenced. Resource creation, subscriptions, account upgrades and inference remain separate future actions.

## Can the credits cover two months?

The small-host workload appears affordable, but a complete public deployment has not been priced or verified. Use **$100** as the initial planning ceiling: eligible new customers receive $100 at signup; the additional $100 depends on activities. Preserve the **Free account plan**, which ends at six months or credit exhaustion. A Paid account plan can charge beyond credits. The screenshot confirms the plan end date; individual credit expiry/applicability remains a separate Billing check.

Reference Region: `us-east-1`, not yet selected. This **60-day continuous-running estimate** uses 1,440 hours and two 30-day storage months. Rates and model details are in the [pricing research](cap04-pricing-research.md). No account entitlement or quota has been checked.

| Component                              | Calculation            | Estimated credit consumption |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------: |
| Linux `t3.small`, standard CPU credits | 1,440 × $0.0208        |                      $29.952 |
| One public IPv4                        | 1,440 × $0.005         |                       $7.200 |
| 20 GB gp3, baseline performance        | 20 × $0.08 × 2         |                       $3.200 |
| Hosting subtotal                       | Rounded after addition |                   **$40.35** |

For illustration, **10,000 total model calls** over 60 days averaging 4,000 input and 600 output tokens consume 40 million input and 6 million output tokens. This includes interpretation, advice, repairs and retries, not 10,000 shopper messages. These averages are assumptions, not measured token bounds.

| Candidate, pending qualification and account access | Demo model estimate | Separate 300-call qualification | Hosting + both workloads |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------: | ------------------------------: | -----------------------: |
| Amazon Nova Lite v1                                 |               $3.84 |                         $0.1152 |               **$44.31** |
| OpenAI gpt-oss-20b on Bedrock                       |               $4.60 |                         $0.1380 |               **$45.09** |
| OpenAI gpt-oss-120b on Bedrock                      |               $9.60 |                         $0.2880 |               **$50.24** |

These totals exclude the unresolved public HTTPS path, logs, transfer, backups, optional services and non-credit-covered charges. They are **not an all-in quote**. No domain purchase, paid speech, NAT gateway, load balancer or GPU training host is included. Keep offline training on the owner's local RTX 3060. A proposed internal envelope of **$80 in eligible credits** would leave $20 of the initial $100 unallocated; adopt it only after pricing public access. It is not a billing cap or spending authorization.

Recommendation: **finish local cloud-readiness work before deploying resources**, then run a short rehearsal before starting the public demo window. There is no present cost-based reason to wait until the final submission week. Documentation is due 16 October, implementation 30 November and the final demonstration/reports 4 December; expiry must cover the chosen window.

## Public-link design changes needed

The original shared-cart limitation is addressed by the local
[shopper-isolation implementation](shopper-isolation-verification.md), whose final
verification is recorded separately. State remains ephemeral and anonymous.
The earlier client-certificate/IP-allowlist proposal does not provide the requested
shareable public experience. Resolve and verify these items before exposure:

1. Server-issued shopper identity and authorization binding browser, Agent session, cart, fictional orders and mutation authority. Every read, Action, ActionResult, Confirmation and Undo must respect ownership. Caller-supplied IDs and CORS alone are insufficient.
2. Independent shopper state, expiry and measured concurrency limits. Ephemeral state remains acceptable for a graduation demo with explicit reset notices and fresh authority after restart. Never replay uncertain Actions. If parallel public use cannot be made safe within scope, keep deployment pending.
3. Verified domain-free HTTPS entry points preserving distinct Panel/Storefront origins, secure origin connectivity, iframe/cookie behavior, SSE and microphone support. An EC2 HTTP address or untrusted certificate is not sufficient. Do not assume CloudFront's $0 flat-rate plan works on a Free AWS account; service-plan and account-plan eligibility differ.
4. Server-side request/token/concurrency limits and a durable global inference allowance. Decide and test admission/abuse controls: creating new browser sessions must not bypass the global limit. A publicly reachable demo need not grant unlimited model calls.
5. Existing origin, Sensitive Field, bound Confirmation, stale/duplicate Action and refresh-recovery guards; protected operational routes; bounded redacted logs and an inference-disable switch.

This is cloud-readiness work for the Controlled Storefront, not a general retailer platform. CAP-05 must still qualify the model on the project's languages and structured contract; cheap inference does not establish accuracy.

## Financial and account gate

Stay on the Free account plan; do not upgrade to unlock a service. If a required model or hosting path is unavailable, revise the design or leave the gate open. Do not create/join AWS Organizations or enable Control Tower: AWS documents upgrade and credit-loss consequences. Verify the actual signup experience and credit applicability before selecting a model or accepting provider terms. [AWS Free Tier FAQ](https://aws.amazon.com/free/free-tier-faqs/).

Budget notifications are delayed and cannot guarantee a card-spending ceiling on a Paid account. Application limits control inference, not infrastructure bills. Keep a resource inventory, teardown date and local evidence copies before Free-plan closure. [AWS Budgets limitations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/latest/userguide/budgets-managing-costs.html).

Next: settle domain-free HTTPS, shopper isolation, model access and the all-in credit envelope locally; recheck the Free plan, remaining balance, credit applicability and expiry before provisioning. The existing account needs no reversal or upgrade. CAP-02 independent evaluation and CAP-03 final same-input comparison remain open. No AWS account access, resource, inference, subscription or upgrade occurred for this document.
