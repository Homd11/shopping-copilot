# AWS reward activities paused safely — 28 October 2026

The owner requested stopping for the usage limit and continuing tomorrow. No
further reward, project, resource-creation or model work is permitted until resumed.

| Activity   | Final observed status                         | Reward                | Trial resources                                                         |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| EC2        | Completed earlier                             | USD20 already earned  | Original project host remains stopped                                   |
| Budgets    | Completed today                               | USD20 newly earned    | Temporary monitoring budget deleted                                     |
| Lambda     | Completed today                               | USD20 newly earned    | Function URL, function and dedicated role deleted; no log group remains |
| RDS/Aurora | Not started                                   | USD20 still available | No database, network helpers, scheduler or cleanup role was created     |
| Bedrock    | Not started; Nova Micro invocation quota zero | USD20 still available | No prompt, subscription, batch job or provisioned model                 |

Today added **USD40** in rewards. Total extra rewards earned are **USD60 of USD100**.
The final Free-plan API reports **USD159.79 remaining**. This is the observed
balance, not a finalized service-billing measurement. The Lambda demo returned
HTTP200 through its AWS_IAM-authenticated URL with one signed invocation. No
unauthenticated URL or project dependency was introduced. Budgets monitoring had
no automatic actions, report subscription or message recipients.

Fresh owner-pause inventory verified zero trial budgets, functions, databases,
schedules, security groups, roles and log groups; zero active EC2 instances and
zero EIPs in Stockholm. The reward operation is closed/owner-paused; its local
cleanup worker exits on the closed state. The original encrypted20GiB project
disk and small DynamoDB table remain intact and still incur storage usage under
their existing allocation. No provider key, non-resetting USD2 cap, reserve,
canonical ledger, project service or public deployment was changed.

The approved [temporary resource proposal](aws-credit-rewards-20261028.md) had a
USD1 existing-credit ceiling, activeFree/USD0cash and a three-hour session. Only
Budgets/Lambda ran; no RDS creation or timed deletion infrastructure was reached.
Do not reuse this closed clock/grant tomorrow for RDS. Resume by recovering the
checkpoint and proposing the remaining exact renewed execution scope. Bedrock
remains blocked by the read-only zero invocation quotas; do not retry the consumed
project diagnostics or assume a paid-account upgrade is allowed.

Local operator safety tests:10passed, including API-shape validation, no project
Start permission, private encrypted DB bounds, IAM-only URL, exact deletion target,
credential redaction, ownership-based uncertain-SG recovery and early RDS cutoff.
A fresh safety review was completed before paid trial creation; RDS-only helper
changes were checked locally but **not executed on AWS**. Keep that distinction
when resuming. Production application bytes remain unchanged.

The previous CAP-07 host session also closed cleanly. Its finite off-host
generation3 lifecycle worker completed at20:44:19UTC, inside its original23:29:28UTC
end. The verified receipt reports authority stopped/generation3/recoverable with
stop intent settled, finish_done and operation_closed. No EC2 was kept running.
