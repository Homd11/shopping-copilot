# CAP-04 network and cost refresh — 19 October 2026

Public-source research only; no account calls, resources, DNS changes, subscriptions
or inference. **The owner’s selected console Region is `eu-north-1` (Stockholm)**; `us-east-1`
prices below remain comparison references. This is not an AWS quote, spending
permission or a claim of account entitlement. Existing local
five-Shopper evidence does not establish EC2 capacity.

## Account and service boundary

The owner’s 19 October screenshots, relayed during this session, show **Free account
plan, $100.00 remaining, $0 current-month spend, 171 days remaining, ending 7 April
2027**. Activities show 0/5 completed and $0/$100 earned. Offered rewards are not
balance; do not launch RDS or invoke a model to earn them. Screenshots also show
the **new AWS experience** (Projects/Team/Billing); its documented project rules
therefore apply. Individual credit expiry, covered services, quotas and model
access remain unverified. The owner can open the Bedrock catalogue (54 models
shown); catalogue visibility is not Invoke entitlement or quota evidence. No
account identifier or private console URL is retained. The owner subsequently confirms gpt-oss-20b details and the CloudFront dashboard open normally; this still does not establish model invocation or specific certificate/distribution feature authority. Confirm the project home Region in Settings before resource creation.

AWS says a Free account closes after six months or credit exhaustion, whichever
comes first. Paid accounts can incur charges beyond credits. Preserve Free; do not
join Organizations, enable Control Tower or use another documented automatic
upgrade trigger. [Account-plan rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/free-tier-plans.html).

The limited-rollout **Sign up for AWS (new)** matrix lists EC2/EBS/VPC, CloudFront,
Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, CloudWatch and Bedrock in its Free selection. It excludes
Lambda@Edge and multi-/cross-Region features. This matrix describes that signup
experience; it does not prove that every feature is enabled for this owner.
CloudFront **flat-rate plans, including the $0 plan, require a paid account** and
are excluded. Ordinary CloudFront pay-as-you-go is a separate candidate. AWS lists
`t3.small` among the post-15-July-2025 credit-supported instance types.

[EC2 eligibility](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/LaunchingAndUsingInstances.html).

Regional resource creation is locked to the project Region. Changing contact
details does not change it; activating advanced features requires a **Paid-plan
upgrade**, so it is outside this project’s constraint. Global services have an
exception; AWS specifically warns that CloudFront features creating resources
outside the project Region can be unavailable. The published managed Region SCP specifically excepts `acm:*` and `cloudfront:*` from its `us-east-1` deny, and its Free policy separately blocks exportable certificate requests. Non-exportable CloudFront viewer ACM certificates are therefore not categorically excluded by the documented Region policy. This is policy interpretation, not a grant of IAM permission or proof that this owner can request a certificate. Read-only account-page visibility and eventual separately authorized issuance remain acceptance checks.

[published project/Free managed policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/scps-and-rcps-for-projects.html).

Bedrock APIs that do **not** create resources have a documented exception allowing
all enabled-by-default commercial Regions. Direct invocation of a regional model
endpoint is distinct from a geographic/global inference profile; do not infer that
the project lock forces all inference into Stockholm or enables cross-Region
profiles. Current model cards show **In-Region Stockholm support for Nova Lite,
gpt-oss-20b and gpt-oss-120b**. Start qualification planning there; US endpoints are
only a documented alternative pending account access, network cost and latency.

## Conditional topology recommendation

| Candidate                                                               | Ingress and egress                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Decision implication                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Direct EC2 HTTPS; manual start/prewarm                                  | Both approved sibling names point to one retained EIP; Caddy terminates trusted HTTPS. A public subnet, IGW route and outbound HTTPS support maintenance, deployment artifacts, administration and regional model endpoints without NAT. Restrict administration separately.                                    | Smallest baseline. Prefer this if manual availability is acceptable or optional wake services are unavailable. While stopped, the host cannot serve its own waiting page. Certificate issuance/renewal and actual public-browser acceptance remain required.                                                                                           |
| Two pay-as-you-go CloudFront distributions; protected public EC2 origin | Preserve `app.scpilot.tech` and `store.scpilot.tech`. Restrict origin ingress to CloudFront’s origin-facing prefix list **and** a checked secret origin header; the prefix list alone admits other distributions. Retain outbound public HTTPS for maintenance/model traffic. Price the EIP even while stopped. | Useful if an independent S3 waiting page and Lambda control path are needed. Define separate waiting/control behaviors and stopped-origin error handling; do not cache personalized HTML, API, cookies or SSE. Requires ACM viewer certificate in `us-east-1` plus separately valid origin TLS/name routing. No flat-rate bundled WAF/DNS assumptions. |
| CloudFront VPC origin; private EC2                                      | Private origin connectivity does not provide outbound connectivity. Requires IGW attached to VPC, a supported subnet/AZ and service-managed ENI. S3/DynamoDB gateway endpoints cover those services only; Bedrock/SSM endpoints do not provide general package-registry or OS-update egress.                    | Defer selection until a complete maintenance/deployment/admin/model egress design is priced. Do not add a standing NAT gateway merely for wake. IPv6-only egress needs actual endpoint/package compatibility proof.                                                                                                                                    |

These are design recommendations, not tested cloud connectivity. AWS documents
origin restrictions using [custom headers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/add-origin-custom-headers.html)
and the [managed prefix list](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/LocationsOfEdgeServers.html#managed-prefix-list).
Public IPv4 plus an IGW route is described in [VPC internet access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Internet_Gateway.html).
Current [VPC-origin requirements](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-vpc-origins.html)
include `eu-north-1`, and `us-east-1` **except AZ ID `use1-az3`**; this is regional availability, not
owner access. That page no longer lists WebSockets among exclusions; do not reuse
an older categorical restriction as current evidence. SSE still needs deployment
acceptance. No extra service-managed private-ENI address fee is documented there.

For CloudFront SSE, distinguish origin **read timeout** (first packet and gaps;
default 30 seconds) from **response completion timeout** (whole response). An unset
completion timeout imposes no total maximum; a configured 60-second completion
timeout ends a long stream even with heartbeats. Send packets comfortably inside
the chosen read timeout, disable buffering/caching, forward event cursor and
required authorization/Origin headers, then verify reconnect without Action replay.
GET retry behavior is not permission to replay a Mutation.

## Complete illustrative 60-day bill of materials

Assume 1,440 elapsed hours, two normalized 30-day storage months, **20 GB total gp3
including OS/releases/catalogue/log headroom**, one retained EIP, and either 120
running hours (2 h/day including starts, maintenance and idle tail) or all 1,440.
This duty cycle is an assumption: a 60-minute idle timer does not guarantee it.
No free request/transfer allowances are deducted in this conservative arithmetic.

| Candidate manual/direct category, US reference                             | 120 running h / 1,320 stopped h | 1,440 running h |

| gp3, retained throughout                                                   |                          $3.200 |          $3.200 |

| S3 backup/release storage: average 1 GB, 1,000 PUT/LIST + 10,000 GET total |                          $0.055 |          $0.055 |
| Logs: 1 GB total ingestion + conservative 1 GB-month retained              |                          $0.530 |          $0.530 |
| 20 GB total outbound, including shopping/admin/maintenance; gross $0.09/GB |                          $1.800 |          $1.800 |
| Demo inference allocation, all interpretation/advice/repairs/retries       |                         $10.000 |         $10.000 |
| Separate qualification allocation                                          |                          $1.000 |          $1.000 |
| **Scenario total before contingency**                                      |                     **$26.281** |     **$53.737** |

Standing US **compute/storage/address subtotal** is `$10.40 + $0.0208 × running_hours`.
For a wholly stopped 60 days, EBS/EIP alone still consume **$10.40**; backup/log
retention and independently served waiting/control traffic remain additional.
Stockholm uses `$10.544 + $0.0216 × running_hours`; its logs scenario costs $0.568.
With the other stated allocations, Stockholm manual/direct totals are **$26.559
at 120 running hours** and **$55.071 continuous**. Its wholly stopped EBS/EIP floor
is **$10.544**. These include the same $11 inference/qualification allocations.
Do not hibernate or retain an unnecessary second root/data disk. More than 20 GB
required in deployment increases the estimate.

Inference allocation is a planning envelope, not a new permission or configured
ledger. At the historical 4,000-input/600-output average, 10,000 total calls cost
$3.84/$4.60/$9.60 for the three candidates respectively; 300 qualification calls
for **each** candidate total $0.5412. Stockholm Nova Lite instead gives $4.16 for
10,000 calls and $0.5508 for all three qualification batches combined. These are
average token scenarios, not bounds.
CAP-05 must qualify exact models/access and reserve worst-case billable tokens.

All remaining categories are explicit: existing external DNS/domain **$0 incremental
assumed**, subject to verified DNS access/provider policy; no Route 53 purchase.
Trusted ACME certificate is the direct-path proposal; CloudFront ACM non-exported
viewer certificates are the alternative. EBS encryption is included. IAM roles,
security groups, routes and IGW need no separately provisioned paid appliance.
Use basic monitoring and bounded local logs; the log allowance also covers optional
wake logs. EBS snapshots/AMI copies, customer-managed KMS keys, Secrets Manager,
WAF, Shield Advanced, API Gateway, load balancers, NAT gateways, interface endpoints,
ECR/CI services, scheduled managed orchestration, paid support, cross-Region copies
and persistent databases beyond the small optional control table are **not selected
($0)**. If any becomes necessary, add its full charge before selecting topology.
S3 storage above includes bounded catalogue backups, not restoring an old inference
allowance. Taxes/credit exclusions are account checks, not assumed covered.

## Optional always-available waiting and wake path

Conditional design: S3 waiting assets through pay-as-you-go CloudFront; a separate
uncached control behavior reaches a regional Lambda Function URL; DynamoDB stores
invitation/lifecycle generation/lease state outside EC2. Keep Lambda outside the
VPC: it can call AWS control APIs without a NAT solely for wake. Use CloudFront OAC
with `AWS_IAM` and the documented invoke permissions to prevent bypass of the
distribution. Validate invitation and durable rate limits **before StartInstances**;
ordinary page/status traffic never starts EC2. Do not sleep in Lambda while booting.

Illustrative **additional** two-month workload, served even while EC2 is stopped:

| 100,000 Lambda invocations including denied/poll traffic, 128 MB, 200 ms each                               |                               $0.0617 |
| 100,000 billable RRU + 100,000 billable WRU; 0.01 GB control storage × 2 months conservatively at paid rate |                               $0.0800 |
| 100,000 additional S3 GET + 0.002 GB waiting assets × 2 months                                              |                               $0.0401 |
| 100,000 CloudFront HTTPS requests + 1 GB outbound at Middle East reference rates                            |                               $0.2300 |
| Optional 100,000 viewer Function executions, conservatively at post-free rate                               |                               $0.0100 |
| **Additional scenario total, rounded up**                                                                   |                             **$0.43** |

These incremental wake rows use US control-service rates; substituting the verified
Stockholm DynamoDB rates gives $0.08583 for its row and still rounds the combined
wake increment up to **$0.43**. This table counts waiting/control traffic only.
For the **two-distribution main CloudFront candidate**, replace the direct $1.80
transfer allocation with **20 GB main viewer transfer × $0.11 + 1M main HTTPS
requests × $0.012/10,000 + 1 GB separate admin/maintenance egress × $0.09 = $3.49**.
AWS-to-CloudFront origin transfer is waived; do not add it again. Viewer rates
depend on actual serving location; these Middle East figures are an explicit
scenario, not a global maximum. [CloudFront transfer rules](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/pricing/).

CloudFront advertises **1 TB transfer + 10M requests/month account-wide** under
pay-as-you-go Free Tier; Lambda also advertises free monthly requests/compute.
These can reduce actual consumption but are not flat-rate entitlements or abuse
caps. Viewer geography, bot requests, polling, retries, table transactions and
logs must be counted. Invocation-level invitation rejection still incurs request
work; reserved concurrency limits simultaneous work/RPS, not two-month spend.
Finite request budgets and a disable/teardown procedure are required before public
exposure. [CloudFront allowance distinction](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/faqs/),
[Lambda pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/),
[Function URL throttling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-urls.html#urls-throttling).

The named services are publicly listed in the Free-plan matrix, but **Function URL,
CloudFront/OAC/Functions, DynamoDB and S3 feature access for this owner remains
unverified**. Function URLs are not available in every Region; confirm the selected
regional feature and account quota. Do not upgrade to make wake work. If eligibility,
remote lifecycle adapter, safe waiting routing or complete pricing fails, retain
manual start/prewarming and describe its availability limitation honestly.
[Function URL availability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-urls.html).

With main CloudFront traffic and wake included as above, the continuous candidate
rounds up to **$55.86 US reference / $57.20 Stockholm**, leaving **$22.80** in the
Stockholm case within a proposed $80 envelope and a separate **$20** of the currently
evidenced $100 unallocated. These are contingency allocations, not hard AWS caps.
Actual credit applicability, expiry, project home Region, feature/model eligibility,
DNS editing access and a complete selected topology still block closure of Ticket 02;
public-source arithmetic alone cannot close it. Deployed capacity, public-domain
TLS issuance/operation and cloud lifecycle behavior belong to CAP-06/07 acceptance,
not this no-resource feasibility gate. **Next:** use Stockholm as the
resource baseline, verify DNS editing and the detailed credit/feature evidence,
then choose direct/manual if the CloudFront/ACM/wake features cannot be established
without upgrading. Re-price any added requirement before provisioning.
