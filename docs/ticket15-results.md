# Ticket 15: recorded results — 2026-09-28

**Acceptance: not passed.** These are three consecutive full runs of the frozen 44-case real-model/browser evaluation. Earlier failed experiments remain separate; their results are not substituted into this set.

## Configuration and reproducibility

OpenRouter `google/gemini-2.5-flash`; streaming enabled only in the evaluation service; reasoning disabled; temperature 0; maximum output 1,536 tokens; schema 8; prompt `intent-v25` (or its bounded repair variant). The normal application retains its non-streaming default. No shopper phrase parser was added.

Baseline: `ceee215c532368aaf99766c85d0ef634ea7b5ec5`. The raw reports contain the full scenario definitions and SHA-256 hashes of every Agent, Bridge, Panel, Storefront and evaluation Python/TypeScript source file. Those hashes were compared with the final working tree before recording this summary.

Case manifest SHA-256: `3ac383a317171814091d34ab6c43ecd3ea273bf6df7c8333dd396dc76c2566dd`.

See [the evaluation contract](ticket15-evaluation.md) for commands, assertions, case classification and timing definitions. Raw reports are retained locally under ignored `eval/reports/milestone-20260928-213346/`; they are not included in the public repository.

The browser Action target excludes model interpretation. First-Action latency including interpretation is shown separately; these results do not mean complete shopping requests finish within two seconds. Near-zero serialization samples reflect browser timer resolution. Phases are samples, not additive task durations.

**Outstanding gate:** run 3, `orders-login`, has one rejected provider stream with recorded TTFT/elapsed time but no recorded token/cost usage. Its repair succeeded and the scenario passed. Because the evidence cannot establish complete usage for that attempt, run 3 fails measurement completeness. The unavailable value is not replaced with zero. Ticket 15 remains incomplete solely on this final-run measurement gate; no further paid reruns were made.

## Earlier failures and scope of evidence

The preceding full set (`milestone-20260928-212157`) scored 43/44, 44/44 and 42/44 and did **not** pass acceptance. It exposed a quantity-decrease repair that still selected a textbox, lost usage/TTFT on rejected streams, and a Stop test that clicked after the message response had already permitted an Action. Repairs supply current executable button identities to the model, retain received metrics even on stream errors, and hold the model response in the evaluation service until Stop has completed. Original failures remain in their own reports.

Other development runs exposed missing discovery categories and harness errors in clarification controls, refresh measurements and Undo state lookup. Two deliberately category-omitted filter requests permit one clarification and are excluded from the fully-understood efficiency denominator; all seven fully specified filters remain included. These decisions preceded the final three runs. Failed cases were not discarded or silently reclassified during the final set.

Independent Spec and Standards reviews prompted stronger cart, Spotlight, material, timing and gate assertions. The final follow-up could not run because reviewer agents reached their usage limit; subsequent narrow changes were reviewed locally. No claim of final independent sign-off is made.

These 44 fixed conversations are a bounded regression sample with a nondeterministic model, not proof that every messy phrase works. The Stop hold is evaluation instrumentation, and two direct Bridge guard cases are runtime-safety evidence rather than language-understanding evidence. Ticket 16 remains the uncoached participant study; independent-storefront compatibility and production readiness remain outside this gate.

## Raw-report integrity

Final local verification completed 2026-09-29: **410 Python + 155 TypeScript tests passed**, including the full scripted browser suite. Prettier, ESLint, Ruff lint/format and all builds passed. These regression checks do not call the paid provider.

The final read-only key check reported a $0.75 non-resetting cap and $0.046856858 remaining. The allowance decreased by about $0.4881 during all Ticket 15 development and evaluation, including failed experiments. The final three runs have $0.16271332 of recorded provider cost plus the one attempt with unavailable usage. No cap was raised, no credits were purchased, and no further paid reruns followed this set.
