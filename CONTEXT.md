# Shopping Copilot

The Shopping Copilot helps a shopper complete shopping tasks on an ecommerce storefront through natural language while keeping consequential actions visible and under the shopper's control.

## Language

**Shopping Copilot**:
The assistant that interprets a Shopper's request and helps carry it out on a Storefront.
_Avoid_: Bot, generic agent

**Shopper**:
The person asking the Shopping Copilot for help and retaining control over consequential choices.
_Avoid_: User, customer, operator

**Storefront**:
The ecommerce experience in which the Shopper browses products, manages a cart, checks out, and reviews orders.
_Avoid_: Website, target site, shop UI

**Storefront Definition**:
The authoritative description of a Storefront's known capabilities and constraints, including its vocabulary and configured currency.
_Avoid_: Site map, agent configuration, hardcoded store knowledge

**Controlled Storefront**:
The Storefront owned by this project and used to develop and evaluate the local MVP under reproducible conditions.
_Avoid_: Fake store, fixture site, our store

**Shopping Task**:
A bounded goal expressed by the Shopper that the Shopping Copilot either completes, safely hands back, or declines as off-topic.
_Avoid_: Job, workflow, prompt

**Constraint**:
A Shopper-supplied condition that narrows acceptable results, such as category, use, price, or size.
_Avoid_: Filter when referring to the Shopper's intent

**Catalogue Fact**:
An explicit Storefront assertion about a product's identity, availability, property, or suitable use. An absent fact is unverified, not a fact the Shopping Copilot may infer from a product name.
_Avoid_: Model guess, implicit product knowledge

**Exact Match**:
An available catalogue product for which every explicit non-negotiable Shopper requirement is verified by authoritative product facts.
_Avoid_: Search hit, plausible product

**Alternative**:
An available catalogue product offered despite one or more named unmet or unverified Shopper requirements, never presented as an Exact Match.
_Avoid_: Match, silent fallback

**Styling Suggestion**:
An available catalogue product proposed for an open-ended coordination goal. Its product details and explicit requirements are verified; its colour-coordination advice is a styling opinion, not a product fact or a guarantee.
_Avoid_: Personalized recommendation, model guess

**Owned Outfit Context**:
The garments and footwear a Shopper already has and wants to coordinate with. Their properties describe the owned items, not requirements for the product being sought.
_Avoid_: Desired product filters, shopping history

**Styling Preference**:
A soft coordination idea, such as a neutral or complementary colour, used to rank otherwise acceptable products. It cannot silently replace or relax a Shopper's explicit Constraint.
_Avoid_: Mandatory filter, verified suitability

**Snapshot**:
A semantic description of the current Storefront state that contains only the information needed to understand available interactions.
_Avoid_: DOM dump, page scrape

**Action**:
One proposed interaction with the Storefront in service of the current Shopping Task.
_Avoid_: Tool call, command, operation

**Spotlight**:
A visual cue that identifies a relevant Storefront element while leaving the next choice to the Shopper.
_Avoid_: Highlight, tooltip

**Sensitive Field**:
A field whose value the Shopping Copilot must neither read nor enter, including credentials, payment-card data, and one-time codes.
_Avoid_: Secret input, protected textbox

**Mutation**:
An Action that changes shopping state or commits a consequential choice.
_Avoid_: Write action, side effect

**Reversible Mutation**:
A cart Mutation whose precise prior state can be restored through Undo without further Shopper input.
_Avoid_: Safe action, unimportant change

**Guarded Mutation**:
A destructive or terminal Mutation that requires Confirmation before it may execute.
_Avoid_: Dangerous click, high-risk tool call

**Confirmation**:
An explicit Shopper decision that authorizes one specific Guarded Mutation within the current Shopping Task.
_Avoid_: Approval, consent prompt

**Undo**:
A time-limited opportunity to restore the exact shopping state that existed before a Reversible Mutation.
_Avoid_: Rollback, cancel

**Money**:
An exact decimal amount paired with the ISO currency configured by the Storefront Definition.
_Avoid_: Price number, floating-point amount

**Intent Interpreter**:
The Agent-side model boundary that converts one current Shopper message into a versioned, validated Intent and Constraints. It has no authority to select or execute an Action.
_Avoid_: Brain, autonomous planner, action model

**Structured Intent**:
The versioned result of Intent interpretation: language, dialect, intent kind, canonical Constraints, browsing or recommendation goal, Owned Outfit Context, and clarification state.
_Avoid_: Raw model response, free-form plan

**Intent Boundary**:
The deterministic validation point between model output and Shopping Task planning. It rejects malformed output, unsupported Money, vocabulary values outside the Storefront Definition, and conversational-only outcomes before they can become Actions.
_Avoid_: Model safety, implicit guardrail
